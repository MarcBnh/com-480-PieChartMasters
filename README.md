## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

The general topic of our visualization is about the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. The main goal is to understand the evolution of the crisis geographically and temporally.

Here is an overview of the stylzed facts we want to show through some idea of visualization :
1. Understand the dynamics of mortgage defaults:
    - With an interactive map of the United State, we want to highlight how mortgage defaults spreads over time in order to identify regional clusters of high default rates.
    - With the same visualization we could also shows whether defaults started in specific locations.
    - If we add other economic factors (such as real estate price, unemployment, and other factors), we can highlight possible correlations on another visualization. 

2. Understand the international impact of mortgage defaults:
    - With an interactive map of the world, we want to highlight how the crisis spread through worldly through various economic indicators.
    - 

3. Effects on financial markets: visualization of stock indices and bank failures.
4. Socioeconomic consequences: changes in living standards, unemployment, and debt levels.
5. Early warning signals and their spread: using Google Trends to analyze how economic fear propagated.
6. This approach provides a holistic view while allowing for extensions to more recent events, such as the 2020 crisis or current economic tensions.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
